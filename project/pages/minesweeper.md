As practice, I started making Minesweeper. At first, to make sure the logic was correct, I worked on making a command 
line version. After this, I moved on and made a flask interface for the Minesweeper application itself.

To play with the example you'll first have to clone the repository. At a later point, I may deploy a live version.

## Command Line

To run the command line version run `python minesweeper.py`

## HTML Interface

To run the web version run `python minesweeper-flask.py`
