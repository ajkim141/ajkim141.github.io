title: Color Update
date: 2014-10-14 10:48:00

I decided to break up the monotony of the older design by doing some restyling and changing the color scheme. The teal
is the same as before, but I've added red and green to make a simple yet effective tri-color style. I think these
small variations do a lot to make the site more interesting and appealing, as not everything is the same exact color
in every place. Now, the home page and posts are color coded blue, the resume is red, and the external links in the nav
bar are green.

I also made a few slight alterations in other areas to improve readability. I removed the rounded border edges, and
links outside of the nav bar no longer have borders at all. The old link borders were causing strange tangent issues
on some browsers, and I felt it would be more aesthetically appealing to revert to a simpler link style than to give
links additional padding just to accommodate the borders.
