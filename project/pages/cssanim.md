<div id="logo-container">
    <div id="outer-orbit">
        <div id="sub-orbit">
            <div id="sub-c"></div>
        </div>
        <div id="outer-c"></div>
    </div>
    <div id="inner-orbit">
        <div id="inner-c"></div>
    </div>
</div>



For a bit of fun, I decided to try experimenting with animation in CSS. Originally I wanted this design to be an
animated logo in the background of every page (with very low opacity), but I decided it might make reading the site more
difficult. In the future I may redesign the site and add space for a logo, in which case I'll put something like this to
better use.

Note: The animation in its current state is adapted exactly how it would function as a background logo. Small window
sizes may cause it to overlap with other elements, as it is meant to appear in the exact center of the screen. In the
future I may look into a more advanced form of automatic resizing.
