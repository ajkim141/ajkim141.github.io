title: CSS Update 2 - Links and Styling
date: 2014-09-25 1:10:00

Today's changes are relatively subtle. Most of them have to do with fixing an alignment issue with the top navbar, but
I'm also experimenting with link hovering and some new styling on the resume page. Still, as much as I want the resume
page to be interesting, it has to be simple enough that it remains easy to digest. As far as all the teal goes, I
personally enjoy teal, but in the future I may experiment with less exotic colors.
