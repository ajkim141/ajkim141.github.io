<h2>Starting Javascript</h2>
<p>I've made a few small changes to the site over the past few days, but they've all been quick fixes on an as-needed
basis. I decided none of them were substantial enough to warrant their own posts, but I will make a note of them here.
I slightly modified the outlined link format to make them more legible, and I discovered that the Linkedin button
in the header and footer was directing to the wrong location.</p>
<p>Today I've started learning Javascript. Although there is no Javascript currently deployed on this site at the present,
I have some plans for what I would like to do in the near future. As I add more and more updates and posts, the front
page is inevitably going to become rather cluttered. One of the first modifications I would like to make is
automatically sorting the post links on the first page by month and year. After that, I may implement something to
archive posts older than a certain date.</p>
