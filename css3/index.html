<h1>CSS Update 3</h1>
<p>Last night I noticed that while link-hovering worked on my Ubuntu laptop, nothing happened at all when I examined
the site on my Windows desktop. Later, I asked a friend (using a Macbook) to test the links for me, who reported that
the links <em>shrank</em> when hovered over. Today, my first priority was fixing this link-hovering issue in order to keep
the site presentable. In the end, I decided to completely overhaul every link on the site, giving them a unified style
that still highlights when hovered over, but without expanding or contracting.</p>
<p>I also added a footer, which for now is a mirror image of the navbar. In the future I may replace it with only a 
"back to top" button, but it's not a high priority. At this point, only the resume page would need such a thing anyway.
Similar to this, in the future I may add a persistent navbar specifically for posts to allow readers to navigate to
any post without having to return to the homepage.</p>
<p>The current site aesthetic is a bit skeletal, and I'm still not sure whether I like it or not. I'm partial to the 
unified link styling, so I'll most likely keep at least that much in future iterations.</p>
